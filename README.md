# rock_type_detection_ML
Here I'm training a machine learning model that can detect type of rock using computer vision

pip install all the required extensions.

Make a directory (suppose named: 'rock') and dump all the files there.
Create three empty folders inside, named 'testing_data', 'training_data' and 'validation_data'.
Paste your Dataset folder inside the 'rock' directory and rename in to 'Dataset'.
Inside Dataset you must have all the data classified and separated in different folders, whose names are the name of the classification.

*Note: Only have one layer of folders inside Dataset, not further subfolders allowed.

Now run the organise_dataset.py
Then run model.py

You should have your trained model as 'model.h5'.
